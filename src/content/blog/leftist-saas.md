I think one of the most interesting things about SaaS is that we talk about A Product, a solid thing, a piece of software, when it's actually quite _alive_. That 'product' is actually a wiggly, squishy, knit-together quilt of variations running on different architectures and versions and clouds, supported by a team of (ideally) passionate people.

I know Benn Stancil wrote negatively about some [tangentially similar ideas](https://benn.substack.com/p/do-software-companies-actually-have) fairly recently, positing that there's no magical point where SaaS maintains itself and you can gut all the cost centers and turn an eye-watering profit.

I think about it somewhat differently as somebody who doesn't have much (any) faith in capitalism: I think the promise of SaaS _is software as relationship_. Instead of chucking a piece of software over the fence to you and saying 'good luck', a SaaS company is a continued promise, as a brand, to solve a set of problems for you better and better as time goes on.

That's actually really aligned with the interdependent nature of humanity! I wonder what SaaS would like free of the constraints of capitalism? Contrary to most leftist free software folks, who innately abhor SaaS as a capitalist corruption of software, I think it could be kind of cool. Imagine: portable, repairable, long-lasting devices offloading heavy computation to renewable-powered servers running open source software for you via freely organized server collectives. In exchange for contribution to maintenance, documentation, administration, and building you get computation credits. Stuff like that.

There's a world where open source and SaaS happily support each other, we just have to be willing to build it.
