Bimbos get a bad rap. We're generally portrayed as selfish, shallow, and stupid, but I believe this portrayal is, in fact, rooted in misogyny. I want to make some assertions about the power of bimbo tactics as a life strategy, and why learning to love bimbos will break down the patriarchy in your mind. This article is not just by bimbos, for bimbos, but I hope will also be read by the straight cis men who make up most of the tech industry.

Article forthcoming!
